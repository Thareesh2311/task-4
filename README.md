Task 4: Dashboard Creation & Insights

Description:
In Task 4, you will build an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or Power BI. The goal is to turn your cleaned and analyzed dataset into a visually appealing dashboard that highlights key business insights such as sales performance, profit trends, customer behavior, and product-wise analysis. This task helps you practice how real analysts present data in a clear and decision-friendly format.

Process for Task 4
1. Import the Dataset

Load the cleaned dataset (from Task 1) into Tableau or Power BI.

Verify data types (dates, numbers, categories).

2. Create KPIs (Key Metrics)

Examples:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Total Customers

Average Order Value

Revenue Growth

These KPIs usually appear at the top of the dashboard.

3. Build Visualizations

Create meaningful charts such as:

Sales by Region (Map / Bar chart)

Profit by Category (Bar chart)

Monthly Sales Trend (Line chart)

Top 10 Customers (Table/Bar chart)

Ship Mode or Segment Performance (Pie/Donut/Bar)

4. Add Filters

Include interactive filters:

Region

Category

Year

Segment

This allows users to explore the data deeply.

5. Design the Dashboard Layout

Place KPIs at the top

Charts in a clean grid

Use consistent colors

Avoid clutter

Add titles, legends, and labels

6. Generate Insights

From the dashboard, identify:

Best and worst performing categories

Profit-draining products

High-value customers

Seasonal sales trends

Regions with growth opportunities
